Rule No. 1 No bullying, or anything that is inappropriate(swearing, things that is normally banned)
Rule No.2 this is a SFW serverRule no. 
rule no.3 No self promo unless it is in #self-promo

Punishments - until I find something else then these are rules, 3 warnings, 1 is a 24 hr ban, 2 is a week ban, and 3 is you either get kicked, or banned for a month, then after that, 
depending on what you do, It could mean a permanent ban, but that is if something is justified in my case but, these are minimum punishments, if you feel they are unjust dm me, or if you think
I banned you for a unjust reason dm me
Breaking some rules and behaviors can lead to a permanant ban, with no warnings
